## ⭐ Front-End Repository

## 📌 About the project

### This system was developed so that events at Fatec Itu - Dom Amaury Castanho could have a more practical registration method, making it easier for students, outsiders, and event organizers. Clearly, this system is also used by event organizers to manage and control events, users, banners, categories, etc.

### 👥 This system is being created by: Guilherme Francisco Pereira and José Lucas Martins Gomes as a final project development / Real system

### ✨ Interesting fact!! This is the only system developed solely by students that is implemented and used by the college, including students, professors, coordinators, and more!

## ❔ How to run the project on my machine?

- First of all, you need to have Git installed on your computer. Git is a tool that allows you to clone and manage code repositories.
- Windows: Download Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">here</a> and follow the installation instructions.
- macOS: You can install Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/mac" target="_blank">here</a> or using Homebrew with the brew install git command:
```bash
brew install git
```

- Linux: Use your distribution's package manager, for example, for Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install git
```

- Open a terminal (on Windows, you can use Git Bash, which is installed along with Git).

- Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.

- Run the command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeFranciscoPereira/Eventos_Fatec_Itu-FrontEnd.git
```

- After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder.
```bash
cd Eventos_Fatec_Itu-FrontEnd
```

- Now you can open the project files with your preferred text editor or IDE. Example:
```bash
code .
```

- 🚨 Don't forget that to avoid errors in the code when cloning it, you must run the command below: 🚨
```bash
npm i
```

- Once you have the project on your machine, open the website. To do this, follow the steps below:
- Open the terminal and write the code below to start the site:
```bash
npm run dev
```
