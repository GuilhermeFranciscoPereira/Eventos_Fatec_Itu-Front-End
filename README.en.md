## ‚≠ê Front-End Repository

## üìå About the project

### This system was developed so that events at Fatec Itu - Dom Amaury Castanho could have a more practical registration method, making it easier for students, outsiders, and event organizers. Clearly, this system is also used by event organizers to manage and control events, users, banners, categories, etc.

### üë• This system is being created by: Guilherme Francisco Pereira as a final project development / Real system

### ‚ú® Interesting fact!! This is the only system developed solely by students that is implemented and used by the college, including students, professors, coordinators, and more!

## üõéÔ∏è Updates to this commit

### `./src/components/Modal:` This is like a "window" overlaid on top of the main interface that blocks interaction with background content until closed or confirmed. It's used to display critical information or specific action requests.

### `./src/stores/Modal/modalStore.ts:` Controls the display and clears the application's modal data.

## üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇ How do I find my way around the project?

### All project source code files are in: `./src`

## üõà How the project is structured

- `./public:` Folder containing the static files that Next.js serves directly from the site root, bypassing the build pipeline.
    - `favicon.ico:` Site icon displayed in the browser tab, bookmarks, and on mobile devices.
    - `assets:` Directory within public to organize additional static resources.
    - `images:` Assets subfolder that stores all project images (PNG, JPG, SVG), such as logos, backgrounds, and custom icons.
        - `login:` Folder that will store our photos for use on the login screens (Recover password and two-factor authentication)
        - `readme:` Folder that will store our photos for use in the documentation (README)

- `./src/middleware.ts:` Edge middleware file that authenticates users via JWT cookie, validates token expiration and, based on environment variables, redirects those who are not authenticated to public routes or those who are already authenticated to private routes, preventing unauthorized access.`

- `./src/@Types:` Stores the typings that are reused in the code.
    - `UserRoleProps.ts:` User typings and their roles.

- `./src/app:` This is a Next project. If you don't have any knowledge of Next, look up "App Router Next" to learn more about the project and its folder and route structure! Within the app, we have:
    - `global.css:` Global styles, imported within our layout.tsx to be passed throughout the application.
    - `layout.tsx:` Imports global styles and fonts, sets metadata (such as title and description), and encapsulates the application.
    - `loading.tsx:` This is a special Next.js component to display something loading during data fetch or route changes. To display this to the user, we insert our Loader component.
- `(pages):` Contains all of our application routes, but remember, whenever they are within parent folders, that folder will not be recognized as a route! Our pages:
    - `(public):` Everything inside this folder is our public route pages, which the user can access even without being logged in. Here we have:
    - `page.tsx`: Our first page, also known as our "home" page, is the screen the user sees as soon as they access the site.
        - `Login:` Login screen, when accessing: /Login. Requests email and password for the user to access the platform. If the email and password are correct, the user moves to the 'confirm' stage where they enter the 6-digit code sent to their email to access (2FA).
            - `ResetPassword:` Screen for the user to change their password, when accessing: /Login/ResetPassword. First, it requests email. If available, it moves to the screen to enter the new password, confirm, and enter the 6-digit code sent to the email.

    - `(private):` These are our private route pages, where only logged-in users can access!

- `./src/components:` Where the components that will be reused in various parts of the code are located. In this project, we have the following components:
    - `Buttons:`
        - `ButtonDarkMode:` Button responsible for managing the website's dark mode (light/dark mode). - `ButtonRay:` Button that is reused in various parts of the code, changing the text, etc., based on props.
    - `CodeInputValidation:` Reusable component with 6 boxes for 2FA, both to confirm login and to reset the password.
    - `Header:` Component that remains fixed on all pages because it was inserted within `layout.tsx` and is located at the top of the site.
    - `Inputs:`
        - `InputDefault:` Reusable input that changes data based on received props.
    - `Loader:` Component that shows the user that something is loading.
    - `Modal:` This is like a "window" overlaid on top of the main interface that blocks interaction with background content until closed or confirmed. It's used to display critical information or specific action requests.
    - `Sidebar:` Sidebar menu so the user can switch routes in a more accessible way without taking up too much screen space.
    - `Table:` Reusable table, you just need to pass the columns, the data, and the hidden columns on mobile.

- `./src/hooks:` Here we will store our custom hooks with the logical parts of the application. We separate our hooks by types such as pages, components, and api. 
    - `api:` Here, HTTP methods make requests to the backend.
        - `Auth:` All requests to the backend on /auth/ routes.
            - `Get:` GET requests on /auth/ routes.
                - `getMe:` Used to retrieve user data from the backend, such as name, email, role, etc. 
            - `Post:` POST requests in the /auth/ routes
                - `useLogin:` Requests to the backend to make the login request (generate 2FA code) and confirm the 2FA code to access the account
                - `useLogout:` Calls the logout route to allow the user to log out
                - `useResetPassword:` Requests to the backend to make the password change request (generate 2FA code) and confirm the 2FA code to change the password
    - `components:`
        - `Buttons`: Logical parts of our button components
            - `useButtonDarkMode:` Responsible for handling dark mode, changing the theme based on the user's click! - `Sidebar:`
        - `useSideBar:` Handles the ability to close or open the sidebar menu when clicking the 'X'
        - `CodeInputValidation:`
            - `useCodeInputValidation:` Handles the logical part of two-factor authentication inputs
    - `pages` Page logic, page.tsx files located within the app
        - `(private):` Page logic, page.tsx files located within the app -> (pages/private)
        - `(public):` Page logic, page.tsx files located within the app -> (pages/public)
            - `(public)/Login:` Logical parts of the /Login route
                - `(public)/Login/useYeti:` Controls the Yeti to handle the animation of "interacting" with inputs

- `./src/stores:` Stores for the Zustand library
    - `Modal:`
        - `modalStore.ts:` Controls the display and clears the application's modal data.
    - `User:`
        - `userStore.ts:` To set the user in the application
    - `HydratorZustand.ts:` The Zustand "Hydrator" for direct use in layout.tsx

## ‚ùî How to run the project on my machine?

- First of all, you need to have Git installed on your computer. Git is a tool that allows you to clone and manage code repositories.
    - Windows: Download Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">here</a> and follow the installation instructions.
    - macOS: You can install Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/mac" target="_blank">here</a> or using Homebrew with the brew install git command:
    ```bash
    brew install git
    ```

    - Linux: Use your distribution's package manager, for example, for Debian/Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install git
    ```

- Open a terminal (on Windows, you can use Git Bash, which is installed along with Git).

    - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.

    - Run the command to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeFranciscoPereira/Eventos_Fatec_Itu-Front-End.git
    ```

- After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder.
    ```bash
    cd Eventos_Fatec_Itu-Front-End
    ```

- Now you can open the project files with your preferred text editor or IDE. Example:
    ```bash
    code .
    ```

- üö® Don't forget that to avoid errors in the code when cloning it, you must run the command below: üö®
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

- Once you have the project on your machine, open the website. To do this, follow the steps below:
    - Open the terminal and write the code below to start the site:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```

    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to create the .env file based on everything contained in the file: `.env.example`
