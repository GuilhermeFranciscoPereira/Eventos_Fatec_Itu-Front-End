# This is an example environment file (.env.example).
# It demonstrates how your real environment variables (.env.local) should be structured.

# To set up your actual environment file, follow these steps:
# 1. Duplicate this file and rename it to ".env.local".
# 2. Fill in the required values specific to your environment.
# 3. Never commit your ".env.local" file to version control. It must be private and kept secure.
